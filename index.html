                  644 = 2<sup>2</sup> x 7 x 23
                  645 = 3 x 5 x 43
                  646 = 2 x 17 x 19.

                <p>A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1. Considering natural numbers of the form, <i>a<sup>b</sup></i>, where <i>a, b</i>&lt;100, what is the maximum digital sum?</p>

                <p>That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
                <p>Find the maximum total from top to bottom in <a href="http://www.lvtran.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/triangle.txt">triangle.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
                  <b>NOTE:</b> This is a much more difficult version of <a href="http://lvtran.com/p18/">Problem 18</a>. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2<sup>99 </sup>altogether! If you could check one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it.)
